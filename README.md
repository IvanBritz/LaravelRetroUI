| *Meta privacy trial: Here’s what shareholders allege against Mark Zuckerberg, from illegal data mining to board failures* — **Live Mint** ([mint][1]) | This article discusses a legal complaint filed by Meta shareholders saying that Facebook / Meta executives failed in oversight, allowed “illegal data harvesting operations,” and that the board ignored its duty to enforce privacy obligations. ([mint][1]) | According to the allegation, data of millions of Facebook users was accessed in ways inconsistent with promised user privacy controls. It is tied to past events like the Cambridge Analytica scandal and to alleged continuing failure in governance. ([mint][1]) | Ongoing or recurring — it’s not described as a single isolated incident, but part of repeated privacy / oversight concerns over time. ([BusinessWorld Online][2]) | Probably **not appropriate** — because shareholders argue that the company violated its legal obligations under a 2012 agreement (with the FTC) and allowed privacy risks. If true, then user consent/privacy protections weren’t upheld properly. |
| *Meta investors, Zuckerberg reach settlement to end $8 billion trial over Facebook privacy violations* — **Reuters** ([Reuters][3])                   | This article reports that Meta / Facebook executives settled a lawsuit with investors seeking $8 billion over alleged repeated privacy violations involving user data. ([Reuters][3])                                                                         | The case is based on alleged mismanagement of user data privacy over time — including past fines tied to misuse of personal data (e.g. Cambridge Analytica-related). ([Reuters][3])                                                                                | Ongoing / recurring — this reflects systemic or repeated issues rather than a one-off.                                                                            | It raises significant ethical concerns: if access to personal data was misused or inadequately disclosed, then it was not appropriate. Even though there was a settlement, the allegations suggest failures in governance & privacy protection.    |
| *TikTok fined $600 million for China data transfers that broke EU privacy rules* — **AP News** ([AP News][4])                                         | This article discusses a decision by EU regulators (Ireland’s Data Protection Commission) fining TikTok for improperly transferring European users’ data to China in ways that breached GDPR. ([AP News][4])                                                  | Data of European users were transferred / accessed by staff in China without meeting the level of protection required under EU privacy law.                                                                                                                        | Ongoing / regulatory issue — it reflects non-compliance with law, not just a one-off error.                                                                       | Likely **not appropriate** — because it violates GDPR standards for user data protection. Regulatory bodies found the practices were insufficiently transparent / protective.                                                                      |
